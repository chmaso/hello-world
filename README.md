# hello-world
Just another repository, or is it? When someone says "Hello World!" it isn't just a casual greeting to the rest of humanity. It is an annoucement, something new is just starting. A project, an idea, a new way of doing things is on the horizon, it might be big, it might be small, but someone is making those first tenative steps towards an as yet undefinned goal.

So instead of the mundane starting point everyone uses when learning to code for the first time which has been used countless times, it is like the birth of a child, new, full of potential and an amazing moment for all.
